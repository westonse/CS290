Programming Background:

Favorite programming assignment: My favorite programming assignment that I have
done is probably the merge sort function. I enjoy recursion and logical 
challenges and so I thought it was interesting to figure out how to write
merge sort correctly both recursively and iteratively.

Future interests: I am doing an ECE major with a CS minor and so I have interests
in both the EE and CS side of things. With CS in particular I am interested in things
like artificial intelligence as well as data mining and machine learning. I do not
know a whole lot about those things, but the concepts intrigue me a lot.
