My hobbies include going to the gym and playing sports as well as listening 
to music. My favorite sports are basketball, football, and rugby and my 
favorite type of music to listen to eis EDM.

Programming Background:

Favorite programming assignment: My favorite programming assignment that I have
done is probably the merge sort function. I enjoy recursion and logical 
challenges and so I thought it was interesting to figure out how to write
merge sort correctly both recursively and iteratively.
